TO-DO LIST


A.  Program Description/Scenario

-   This project is a Simple To-Do List API made for managing personal tasks. It serves as an easy 
    way to record, check off, and delete daily tasks. It’s meant for a single user who wants a quick 
    and reliable tool without extra features like collaboration, categories, or reminders. The system 
    focuses only on basic task management and provides simple API endpoints that other apps can use.
 

B.  Features/Use cases

-   The system will include only the essential features for managing categorized tasks,
    commonly known as CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The Create Task feature allows
    users to add a new task by providing a title and selecting a category, such as Personal,
    Work, or Urgent. Each new task is automatically assigned a default status of “Pending.”
    For instance, a user can quickly add a task like “Submit project report” under the Work
    category. The Read feature, or View All Tasks, displays all tasks along with their categories
    and current statuses, helping users easily track their progress across different areas.
    When a task is completed, the Update Status feature enables the user to mark it as “Complete,”
    which may show different behavior depending on its category. Finally, the Delete Task feature 
    allows users to permanently remove tasks that are finished or no longer relevant, ensuring the 
    to-do list remains organized and up to date.



C.  How it will be implemented

-   The program will utilize Java mainly as the preferred programming language, the plan is to make 
    a UI using JavaFX to display the output of our program. The program will be made using Java as the main 
    language. It will use JavaFX to create a simple and easy to use interface where users can add, view, update, 
    and delete tasks. A Task class will store the details of each task like its title, category, and status. A Task 
    Manager class will handle all tasks and perform actions such as adding or removing them. The Main App will 
    connect everything and show the tasks on the screen through JavaFX buttons and text fields. Tasks will be stored 
    in a list while the program is running. Optionally, the data can be saved in a text file so users won’t lose their 
    tasks after closing the app. Overall, this To-Do List will be a simple Java program with a clean JavaFX interface 
    for managing daily tasks easily.
