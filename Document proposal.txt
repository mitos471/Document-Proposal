TO-DO LIST


A.  Program Description/Scenario

-   This project is a Simple To-Do List API made for managing personal
    tasks. It serves as an easy way to record, check off, and delete
    daily tasks. It's meant for a single user who wants a quick and
    reliable tool without extra features like collaboration, categories,
    or reminders. The system focuses only on basic task management and
    provides simple API endpoints that other apps can use.

B.  Features/Use cases

-   The system will include only the basic features for managing tasks,
    known as CRUD Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The Create Task
    feature lets users add a new task by entering a simple title. Each
    new task automatically gets a default status of "Pending." For
    example, a user can quickly add a task like "Take pictures required
    for CoWorld GT." The Read feature, or View All Tasks, allows users
    to see all their tasks along with their current status, helping them
    keep track of what still needs to be done. When a task is finished,
    the Update Status feature lets the user change it from "Pending" to
    "Complete". Lastly, the Delete Task feature allows users to
    permanently remove tasks that are done or no longer needed, keeping
    the list organized and up to date.

C.  How it will be implemented

-   The program will be utilizing Java mainly as the preferred
    programming language, the plan is for the output to show up in the
    terminal first only for experimenting how it will look. However,
    this is not entirely confirmed yet if this is how we want to
    represent our project.
