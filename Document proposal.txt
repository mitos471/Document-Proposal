TO-DO LIST


A.  Program Description/Scenario

-   This project is a Simple To-Do List API made for managing personal
    tasks. It serves as an easy way to record, check off, and delete
    daily tasks. It's meant for a single user who wants a quick and
    reliable tool without extra features like collaboration, categories,
    or reminders. 

B.  Features/Use cases

-   The system will include only the essential features for managing categorized tasks, 
    commonly known as CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The Create Task feature allows
    users to add a new task by providing a title and selecting a category, such as Personal, 
    Work, or Urgent. Each new task is automatically assigned a default status of “Pending.” 
    For instance, a user can quickly add a task like “Submit project report” under the Work 
    category.The Read feature, or View All Tasks, displays all tasks along with their categories 
    and current statuses, helping users easily track their progress across different areas. 
    When a task is completed, the Update Status feature enables the user to mark it as “Complete,” 
    which may show different behavior depending on its category. Finally, the Delete Task feature allows users 
    to permanently remove tasks that are finished or no longer relevant, ensuring the to-do list remains organized 
    and up to date.


C.  How it will be implemented

-   The program will be utilizing Java mainly as the preferred
    programming language, the plan is for the output to show up in the
    terminal first only for experimenting how it will look. However,
    this is not entirely confirmed yet if this is how we want to represent our project.
